We are all set! Run your Phoenix application:

    $ cd discuss
    $ mix phoenix.server

You can also run your app inside IEx (Interactive Elixir) as:

    $ iex -S mix phoenix.server

Before moving on, configure your database in config/dev.exs and run:

    $ mix ecto.create


Phoenix uses an optional assets build tool called brunch.io
that requires node.js and npm. Installation instructions for
node.js, which includes npm, can be found at http://nodejs.org.

After npm is installed, install your brunch dependencies by
running inside your app:

    $ npm install

If you don't want brunch.io, you can re-run this generator
with the --no-brunch option.
